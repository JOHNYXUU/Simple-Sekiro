# Simple Sekiro

This is a action game demo using unity for self practising, mostly for **programming**

## What have done ?

### Game Loop

in directory : [Game Loop](https://github.com/JOHNYXUU/Simple-Sekiro/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Main)

**GameConfig.cs** : storing data like: **numerical data**(such as speed) ; **path of resource**

**GameLoop.cs** : Control the whole game. Update every frame

### Simple 3c system based on state machine

in directory : [3c system](https://github.com/JOHNYXUU/Simple-Sekiro/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/StateMachine)

construct with **State Machine**

note : this part **only for** **logic computing**, contains **no** data for player. 

#### Enum

State enum for every state that my player would be in

#### **Base** 

**Player State** : base Player State class for **Animation** and **Logic**,each includes some useful functions

**Hierarchy State** : maintain some player states , only  **one** sub state works in one frame

**Parallel State**  : maintain some player states , **all** sub state work in one frame

#### Logic

**maintain player's logic state in every frame with four hierarchy state together**

**Arm** :  decide weapon pose 

**Attack** : decide attack mode now 

**Move** : decide player's movement

**Pose** : decide player's lower body

(note :  these four hierarchy state are controlled by **LogicStateMachine which is a parallel state actually** )

#### Anim

**maintain player's animation state, make sure that player's animator controller can switch from one state to another.**

every anim state below has a c# script to change the **parameters** in animator controller,so that player can switch between different animation clips.

each c# script actually **represent one animator state** in controller(in Assets/Resources/Animators/) below

### Simple GO manager system

in directory : [Go manager](https://github.com/JOHNYXUU/Simple-Sekiro/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Manager)

manage game object in scene , mainly for how these game objects update in every frame

**Audio** : control audio to play,pause...

**Enemy** : update enemy's position 

**Input** : record player's input from keyboard and mouse only

**Particle** :  manage particle system base on object pool

**Player** : 3c system and Camera update here

**UI** ：ui update here
